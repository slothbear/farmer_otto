Farmer Otto is a set of tools for automating common tasks in Farmville.

For instance, you might want to craft the items required to fully develop
your
[Wishing Fountain](http://farmville.wikia.com/wiki/Wishing_Fountain).
You'll need 609 drill bits, 293 copper tubes, and 293 cut bamboos. That's a 
lot of clicking *Make It* and *Get It*. For top production, you'll also want
to craft on all of your farms. That's a lot of coordinated clicking to move
through all the farms, crafting on each one. But you figure it's worth it to
get 200,000 coins (plus Coconuts and Jade) each day.

Maybe you're crazed and you want to build Wishing Fountains on each of your
twelve farms. That will require 13,340 crafted items, and produce 2.4 million
coins a day.

You can tell Farmer Otto to perform *all* of those steps for you with this script:

```ruby
standard_farm_count.times do
  travel_to_least_recent_farm
  craftshop :open

  # If your craftshop has fewer than 8 stations, the extra
  # get_it clicks will land in neutral space.
  8.times do
    craftshop :get_it
  end

  # Make twice as many drill bits since a Wishing Fountain stage
  # requires 15 drill bits, 8 cut bamboos, and 8 copper tubes.
  craftshop :drill_bit, :count => 4
  craftshop :cut_bamboo, :count => 2
  craftshop :copper_tube, :count => 2

  craftshop :close
end
```

Farmer Otto uses the conventions of the Ruby programming language to specify
what Otto should do. Some of it might look a little geeky, but there are only
a few concepts you need to learn. Check the
[Wiki](https://github.com/slothbear/farmer_otto/wiki/Ruby-concepts-you-need-to-know)
for some hints.

Still too hard? Let me know; perhaps we can make it even simpler.  If someone
else has already written a script for your task, you might not have to learn
anything â€“ just run the script. Check the scripts directory or the
[Scripts](https://github.com/slothbear/farmer_otto/wiki/Scripts)
page on the Wiki.
